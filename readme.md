## Thin the Herd

This application is built to manage a weight loss competition in the PHP community known as Thin the Herd. Thin the Herd 2015 was started by [@coderabbi](https://twitter.com/coderabbi) in early 2015. The original competition was tracked mostly via emailed weigh-ins. This application hopes to make managing a competition easier by providing an app participants can log in to and update their progress.

This application is based on the Laravel Framework.
